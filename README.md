# TelemetryOverBluetooth

A proof of concept implementation of a telemetry system over bluetooth. Was made for my First Tech Challenge team. 

A computer running the WPF app in the TelemetryOverBluetoothServer folder would act as a server. A phone controlling a robot and running the code in the bluetoothtest folder would connect to the server and could start sending telemetry information. The WPF app could then display the results.
